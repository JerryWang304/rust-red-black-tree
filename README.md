# rust-red-black-tree [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nashenas88/rust-red-black-tree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nashenas88/rust-red-black-tree) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/Nashenas88/rust-red-black-tree/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/Nashenas88/rust-red-black-tree?branch=master)

A (soon to be) collection of multiple ways to implement a Red-Black Tree. The goal is to give others another resource for the various ways that data structures could be written in rust.

Currently (nightly rust 1.9.0), only a 100% safe version of a red black tree is implemented.

This repository only compiles on rust nightly because it relies on the plugin [stainless](https://github.com/reem/stainless). Plugins in rust are only supported in nightly for now.

Pull requests are welcome!
